# Introduction 
This project provides a series of prompts designed to validate pull requests (PRs) with the goal of improving code quality and eliminating bad practices. The prompts help reviewers and contributors identify common issues, enforce best practices, and maintain a high standard of code throughout the development lifecycle.
